**This project compare between K-means and K-means++ algorithm**

### 1. About report

  In this Repo. Report was written in Vietnamese :smile:
  
### 2. Run a code!!!
- Get all code in repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Harly-1506/K-Means-and-K-MeansPlusPLus.git
```
- To visualize how to Kmeans works, I used Pygame to code this App Interface
```
 python Kmean Visualization.py
```
- To see python compress images using **Kmeans algorithm** with sklearn libraly
  - Fisrt you need  to choose image you want to compress, then you can chosse K clusters by using:
  
  ```
  python Choose_K_elbow.py
  ```
  - Then you have **K clusters** suitable, run this file to compress image:
  
  ```
  python Change Img  size.py 
  ```
